        desc:'Big data" refers to extremely large datasets that cannot be easily managed, processed, or analyzed with traditional data management tools or methods. These datasets are characterized by their volume, velocity, and variety, often referred to as the three Vs: Volume: Big data involves vast amounts of data. This can range from terabytes to petabytes and beyond. Traditional data processing systems may struggle to handle such massive volumes efficiently.Velocity: Big data is generated at a high speed. Data streams in rapidly from various sources such as sensors, social media, web logs, and more. Real-time or near real-time processing is often required to derive meaningful insights from this data.Variety: Big data comes in various formats and types. It includes structured data (like databases), semi-structured data (like XML files), and unstructured data (like text documents, social media posts, videos, etc.). This variety adds complexity to managing and analyzing the data.',
