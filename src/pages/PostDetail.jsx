        In the vast world of computer science and algorithms, there exists a fundamental technique for traversing graphs and trees known as Depth-First Search (DFS). This method, often compared to exploring a maze by going as far as possible along one path before backtracking, holds significant importance in various applications ranging from pathfinding to puzzle-solving. In this article, we delve into the depths of DFS, exploring its principles, applications, and variants.

      At its core, DFS is a systematic way to explore all the vertices of a graph or nodes of a tree. The algorithm starts at a selected node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This means that once it reaches the end of a branch, it backtracks to the nearest unexplored node and continues the exploration process until all nodes are visited.

The simplicity of DFS lies in its recursive nature or stack-based implementation. Here's a simplified pseudocode representation of the DFS algorithm:

DFS(node):
if node is not visited:
     mark node as visited
        for each neighbor of node:
            if neighbor is not visited:
                DFS(neighbor)
Applications of DFS
</p>
DFS finds extensive applications across various domains due to its versatility and efficiency. Some notable applications include:

Pathfinding: DFS can be used to find a path between two nodes in a graph or a tree. It explores one branch entirely before moving to another, ensuring that it finds a path and not just a solution.

Topological Sorting: In directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), DFS can be employed to perform topological sorting, which arranges the nodes in a linear order such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, A appears before B in the order.

Cycle Detection: DFS can detect cycles in a graph efficiently. During traversal, if it encounters a visited node, it indicates the presence of a cycle in the graph.

Maze Solving: DFS is used to solve mazes or puzzles by exploring different paths until a solution is found. It's particularly useful when the solution involves a sequence of steps rather than an optimal path.
